Jonathan Swan: Mr. President, thank you for joining us.
Donald Trump: Thank you very much.
-We appreciate you taking the time...
-Yep, good.
-And we appreciate your commitment to answer our questions.
-Sure.
-Really appreciate that. Over the years, I've heard you talk about your adherence to a philosophy called positive thinking. This is the mantra that if you believe something, if you visualize it, then it will happen.
-To an extent; I also think in terms of the downside.
-Right.
-I do. I've been given a lot of credit for positive thinking, but I also think about downside, because only a fool doesn't.
-To what extent do you think that that positive thinking mindset is suitable to handling the worst pandemic that we've seen in a century?
-I think you have to have a positive outlook. Otherwise, you would have nothing without a positive outlook. I think we've done an incredible job, between the ventilators and stopping very infected people from China coming in, meaning putting the ban on China, which, frankly, nobody wanted me to do, practically nobody, cause it was very early in January, then putting the ban on Europe, not an easy thing to do. When you put a ban on Europe, that's a big thing. We would've probably lost hundreds of thousands of lives more had I not done that, and all of the experts, every one of them, not one of them wanted to do it. They thought it was too severe. Three months later, they were all saying, "I'm glad you did it."
-The criticism of you that is most prominent is about the communication, is the public health experts saying that it needs to be based in reality, and they're saying that the wishful thinking and the salesmanship is just not suitable in a time when a pandemic has killed 145,000 Americans. I understand what you're saying, that people need to hear positive thinking, but, you know, for the past five months, it's been, "The virus is totally under control", and the cases have been going up, and the deaths have been going up...
-It hasn't! Look, look!
-But you've been saying it's under control.
-Nobody knew what this thing was all about. This has never happened before. 1917, but it was a totally different. It was a flu in that case, okay? But other than 1917, there's never been anything like this. And by the way, if you watch the fake news on television, they don't even talk about it, but, you know, there are 188 other countries right now that are suffering, some proportionately far greater than we are. Okay? As bad as we are...
-Very few.
-Some proportionately greater than we are. Right now, right now, Spain is having a big spike, and there are tremendous problems in the world. You look at Moscow. Look at what's going on with Moscow. Look at Brazil. Look at these countries, what's going on. This was sent to us by China, one way or the other, and we're never gonna forget it. Believe me, we're never gonna forget it. And we were beating China at every single point. We were beating them on trade. We were beating... we were making progress like nobody's ever made progress. They had, before the pandemic, they had the worst year, Jonathan, that they've had in 67 years. You know that, with the tariffs and everything else I did. We were taking in billions of dollars. I was giving some of it to the farmers. The farmers were doing well because I was targeting, they were targeting the farmers. I was targeting China. We were doing good. Then all of a sudden, the game changed, and I had to close it down. I closed down the greatest economy ever in history.
-... I...
-Wait, and then I closed it down, and now we're open again, and we saved by the way, by closing it down, we saved millions of lives. If we would've gone to herd and we knew very little about the disease, if we would've gone herd, we would've lost millions of people. Millions of people. One person's too much. We're at 140,000 people. One person is too much. We're at 140. We would've lost millions of people. And those people that really understand it, that really understand it, they said it's incredible, the job that we've done, and again, I bring it up...
-Who says that?
-The banning China from coming in...
-But it was already in here by the time...
-What's that?
-It was already here. Like, by the time you banned China, it came in through Europe.
-It was there, but nobody knew the extent. Nobody knew how contagious it was. Maybe China knew.
-But the question is, Mr. President, by June, we knew things were bad, and, you know, the last time I was with you was the day before your Tulsa rally, in the Oval, and, you know, you were saying big, huge crowd. It was indoors. These people, they listen to you.
-Excuse me, Jonathan. We had a 19,000-seat stadium. First of all, we had 12,000 people not 6,000, which you reported and other people reported. But you couldn't even get in. It was like an armed camp...
-Why would you have wanted that?
-... because they had 120 Black Lives Matter people there.
-I understand, but why would you have wanted a huge crowd?
-Well, because that area was a very good area at the time. It was an area that was pretty much over...
-Cases were rising...
-After, after. A month later, it started going up. But Tulsa was a very good. Oklahoma was doing very well as a state. It was almost free. It spiked a month later, month and a half, two months later, but it was a good area. We had a tremendous crowd. We had tremendous response. You couldn't even, it was like an armed camp. You couldn't even get through. You couldn't get anybody in. We had 12,000 people. It was incorrectly reported. The other thing we had that nobody wants to talk about, that only Fox broadcast it: it was the highest rating in the history of Fox television. Saturday night. It was the highest rating.
-Mr. President...
-My speech, you wait a minute. That speech was the highest-rated speech in the history of Fox television on Saturday night, and nobody says that.
-I think you misunderstand me. I'm not criticizing your ability to draw a crowd.
-Well, I...
-Are you kidding me? I've covered you for five years. You draw massive crowds. You get huge ratings. I'm asking about the public health...
-And I canceled another one. I had to cancel it. We were gonna have a great crowd in New Hampshire, and I canceled it for the same reason.
-But here's the question. You know, I've covered you for a long time. I've gone to your rallies. I've talked to your people. They love you. They listen to you. They listen to every word you say. They hang on your every word. They don't listen to me or the media or Fauci. They think we're fake news. They want to get their advice from you, and so when they hear you say, "Everything's under control. Don't worry about wearing masks", I mean, these are people, many of them are older people, Mr. President.
-What's your definition of control? Yeah, under the circumstances...
-It's giving them a false sense of security.
-Right now, I think it's under control. I'll tell you what...
-How? 1,000 Americans are dying a day.
-They are dying, that's true, and you know, it is what it is, but that doesn't mean we aren't doing everything we can. It's under control as much as you can control it. This is a horrible plague that beset us.
-You really think this is as much as we can control it? 1,000 deaths a day?
-First of all, we have done a great job. We've gotten the governors everything they needed. They didn't do their job. Many of them didn't, and some of them did. Someday, we'll sit down. We'll talk about the successful ones, the good ones, look at that smile, the good ones and the bad. We had good and bad, and we had a lot in the middle, but we had some incredible governor. I could tell you right now who the great ones are and who the not-so-great ones are. But the governors do it. We gave them massive amounts of material.
-Mr. President, you changed your message this week. You canceled the Jacksonville convention. You said wear a mask. You're saying that it's gonna get worse before it gets better. It's not something you'd like to say, I know, and you said that.
-By the way, not get worse like the original flow. You understand that. But it won't get worse. Now if you look, Arizona's going down... Texas is going down...
-Here you go with the fake news.
-It's not fake news. It's on video. Pepper-spraying him...
-For 59 days, these people were anarchists and agitators and some protesters, but these were anarchists. These people were beating the hell out of the city. They were beating up our federal buildings and our federal courthouse. We told the police to stop it. To make sure. And their police wouldn't do it, not their police... you're trying now to blame law enforcement instead of anarchists, instead of antifa. It's antifa and anarchists that are causing the problems, not law enforcement. Our law enforcement, if we didn't have people at our courthouse, and they're strong, tough people,and they don't want... they try and be very good, believe me, but if we didn't have people there, you would have your federal courthouse, $600 million building, you would have that thing burned to the ground.
-I'm asking you about tactics and about the unmarked vans where they're rounding people up, and I want...
-Okay, let me tell you about unmarked.
-Could I just finish my question? Because it relates to this, I promise. This is from Rand Paul. "We cannot give up liberty for security. Local law enforcement can and should be handling these situations in our cities, but there is no place for federal troops or unidentified federal agents rounding people up at will". What is your response to Senator Paul?
-First of all, these are Homeland Security people. They're securing a courthouse.
-They're Border Patrol.
-They're Homeland Security. ANd hopefully, they have ICE in there. Camo, gas masks. Hopefully, they have ICE. Now, do you know why they're unmarked?
-Why?
-Because these terrorists, these antifa people, these people that are anarchists and agitators, when they see the name on a uniform of a person, a policeman or law enforcement person, they find out where that person lives, and then they go and they scare the hell out of the person's family, and so they do it for that reason. It's just common sense.There's nothing secret about this. And you know it. You see what's going on right now. We have Chad Wolf. They have people. He's doing a fantastic job. He's the acting head. He's doing a fantastic job. Chad Wolf has pickets outside, very dangerous-looking people outside of his house. He's gonna be just fine. He's tough, and he's got people. But if you have the names on all of these uniforms, you'll have these maniacs in front of their houses, scaring their family and their wives and husbands, whatever it may be. I think it's a very good reason not to have your name. Why should you have identification? "My name is Bill Smith, and here's where I live, and I'm a member of..."
-The really serious concern is the reports of people being rounded up and not being told why they're being detained.That's what's being investigated. Mr. President, the inspector generals...
-Why they're being detained, you know why? You know why they're being detained?
-There's an investigation. Do you support that investigation?
-Well, I haven't seen the result yet. I think that antifa should be investigated, not the law enforcement. They're investigating... have you watched the television? Have you been seeing the violence? Now, if you watch NBC News, like, I watch NBC fake news. I'm watching it. Lester Holt, real beauty. And I'm watching this NBC News sham, and you have a mayor named Wheeler, and he's standing out there, and he's being accosted by the people. You know that. I mean, it's horrible what they're doing to him. Portland. The mayor of Portland. And he thought he'd go out here... what they were doing and saying and everything else to him... I happened to watch it on a different station. He had to get out. He had five security guards. He got out with his life. Okay.
-... Mr. President...
- Wait. If you watch, if you watch NBC News, they make him like he's standing there bravely fighting with the people in a positive sense that everything is wonderful. No. He went out there. He's lucky he got away with his life, because they would've killed him. He had five guards. But NBC News showed it like he's standing with the people for justice.Look, those people, take a look at what they've done to the courthouse. Take a look at what they've done to the streets. Take a look at the violence. This is...
-It's getting worse since they've gone in. It's getting worse.
-No, actually, it's getting better. We had a very good, We've arrested a lot of people, and we now have a ten-year rule. You knock down, you try and knock down our courthouse... you touch our courthouse, you go to jail for ten years.
-Turning to the rest of the country, we haven't seen protests like this since the '60s. I mean, we're seeing...
-These are Democrat-run cities...
-Well, just, if I could finish my question. If I could finish my question.
-And they're doing it for political reasons.
-You said you've done so much for African-Americans.
-I have.
-But there are Americans...
-Criminal justice reform, opportunity.
-Let me finish. There are Americans out in the streets, asking for change. Mr. President, have you ever met with a Black Lives Matter activist to hear them out, hear their arguments?
-Well, Black Lives Matter started off, to me, very badly, because it was "Pigs"...
-Did you ever meet with one?
-"Pigs in a blanket, burn 'em like bacon." That was the first time I ever heard of Black Lives. That was three, four years ago. Pigs meaning policemen. Pigs. Pigs is what they're referring to. "In a blanket. Fry 'em like bacon." I thought it was a bad start. I got off to a very bad start.
-Would you meet with a Black Lives Matter activist?
-I would, but I think right now, when they paint...
-Why haven't you?
-When they paint the sign. Nobody's asked for a meeting. I've never been. Nobody's ever asked me for a meeting. Let me tell you, with African-Americans, I'm doing very well. They had the best employment numbers they've ever had. They had the best job numbers they've ever had. They were making more money than they ever made. We were all set until we got hit by China with the virus. Jonathan, there was, actually, we were becoming a very unified country...
-Do you believe, though?
-... because of my success.
-I understand. Do you believe, though, Mr. President, that many police treat black people differently from white people?
-Well, I hope not. I hope not.
-You've seen the statistics.
-The knee on the neck was a disgrace, okay? It was a disgrace.
-I'm talking about what does systemic racism mean to you?
-I hope the answer to that question is not, do I, does anybody, really answer that question accurately?
-But what about not hope? What about analysis? What's your coldhearted view of it?
-I have seen where there is a difference, and I don't want there to be a difference. I don't like that there would be a difference. But with that being said...
-Why do you think black men are two and half times...
-Police have killed white people.
-I know, but why do you think black men...
-In a larger number, police have killed white people.
-But why do you think black men are two and a half times more likely to be killed by police than white people?
-That, I don't know, but I don't like it.
-But you must have thought about it.
-Why? I don't know why, but I don't like it. I do know this. That police have killed many white people also.
-But proportionately, what does it speak to?
-It speaks to something. If that's the number, you're telling me a number.
-It is the number.
-Okay, if that's the number, it speaks to something that, to me, is unacceptable.
-And what do you do about it, then?
-Well, I think we've already done a lot of things.
-But you haven't. It still exists. Look. I understand your achievements. I know what you're gonna say. I'm not suggesting you haven't done a lot economically.
-I've done a thing called criminal justice reform... that your friend President Obama couldn't get done.
-He's not my friend. I'm asking about that statistic.
-He tried, but he couldn't get it done. I've got criminal justice reform. I got opportunity zones. I took care of the historically black, you know, if you look at what I've done for colleges, for black colleges and universities, I got them funding. Obama never did it. I did more for the black community than anybody with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, whether you like it or not. People say, "Ooh, that's interesting..."
-You believe you did more than Lyndon Johnson, who passed the Civil Rights Act?
-I think I did, yeah.
-How? How possibly did you...
-Because I got criminal justice reform done. I got prison reform. I've done things well, ask...
-He passed the Civil Rights Act.
-And how has it worked out? If you take a look at what Lyndon Johnson did, how has it worked out?
-You think the Civil Rights Act was a mistake?
-Because frankly, it took a long time, but for African-Americans...
-But you think that was a mistake?
-Under my administration, Jonathan, under my administration, African-Americans were doing better than they had ever done in the history of this country, so I did a lot. Job numbers, all of the money. They had money. They were getting great. Their percentage was up. Their housing ownership was up. They did better than they've ever done until we got hit. And now you know what we're doing? I'm building it up again. We're gonna have it. Next year will be a great year,unless it's screwed up by somebody that doesn't know what he's doing, which could happen, but I don't think it will.
-John Lewis is lying in state in the U.S. Capitol. How do you think history will remember John Lewis?
-I don't know. I really don't know. I don't know. I don't know John Lewis. He chose not to come to my inauguration. I never met John Lewis, actually, I don't believe.
-Do you find him impressive?
-I can't say one way or the other. I find a lot of people impressive. I find many people not impressive.
-Do you find his story impressive?
-He didn't come to my inauguration. He didn't come to my State of the Union speeches, and that's okay. That's his right. And again, nobody has done more for black Americans than I have.
-I understand.
-He should've come. I think he made a big mistake.
-But taking your relationship with him out of it, do you find his story impressive, what he's done for this country?
-He was a person that devoted a lot of energy and a lot of heart to civil rights, but there were many others also.
-There's a petition to rename the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, as the John Lewis Bridge. Would you support that idea?
-I would have no objection to it, if they'd like to do it. Yeah, it's a good idea. I would have no objection to it whatsoever.
-Okay. Mr. President, you've been so generous with your time, and we really appreciate it.
-Well, thank you very much.
-Great honor. Thank you.
-Thank you.
