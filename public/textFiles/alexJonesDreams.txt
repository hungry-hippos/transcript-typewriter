Alex Jones: Let me tell you what my deep research and vision is. My crystallized epiphany. To talk about twelve dimensions. Eleven known, twelve being omnipresence, so we don't say it actually exists; to say that is arrogant, so I won't say that but I have had dreams my whole life that come true and the weirdest things. For five years, I had a dream where a lady drops a thing of pickles at the store and then one day I'm there and it's the woman in the pickles dream.
Joe Rogan: That is fucking crazy so for five years you had the same dream and then one day it happened?
-Yes
-Fuck
-For about six months I had a dream of a guy in a purple and green striped shirt. It's not like normal dreams, it's like you're been taken over. You always get vomit, and it's lucid-like, like a lucid dream. So I'm walking around behind a building and all of the sudden there's some dude in a purple and green striped shirt. He attacks me. Six months later it happens, and I mean it. It happens exactly like in my dream.
-So what do you think is going on? All thoughts of yourself aside, just just look at it objectively, what do you think that is?
-You could say that it's human programming and basic brain programming.
-Do you think you're tapping into a time line that maybe you can't access all the time? Maybe that's one of the reasons why you can rant and rave and and when you spew out information the way you do which is very impressive. The way you can talk for three hours straight, I mean, you do the majority of your programs entirely by yourself. You are doing something usual, you understand that?
-I'm not even doing it. It's like a rivers going by. There's a turtle, there's a fish, there's a log. It's like random, like what is this? What is that?
-Exactly. That's how you communicate. Like in the beginning of the show we were talking about Sandy Hook, and I kept trying to slow you down. I was like "I'm not following you down this river". You just hit this one rock I want to talk about, then this other rock I want to talk about, and then the next rock, but you just kept going. The way you think about things, you're chaining one thing to the next thing to the next thing to the next thing and for people who are not thinking the way you're thinking, it could be exhausting.
-It doesn't mean I'm right about it. I'm only seeing like the code but...
-I'm wondering because of the fact you're telling me that you had these dreams that came true exactly the way you dreamt them. I know you're not full of shit. I've known you. You're not a liar. I've known you for a long time. If that really did happen to you, if this is your real life experience, then I want to know what the fuck it is. Are you are you on the periphery? Do you have your finger on a membrane that maybe other people can't totally touch or occasionally just get a little peek through? Then you get to see the other side, even if it's only once or twice in your life. Who's to say that what you're experiencing by being able to see these things that manifest themselves realistically in the future, that this isn't what human beings will have five years from now or a hundred years from now.
-Sure, it's like being a magic artist when...
-We think we're all the same. That's the thing. We think we're all the same. We're not all the same. We're not all the same in our ability to talk. You can talk for a lot longer than I do. Eddie Bravo could talk about jujitsu better than both of us can. So there's certain things that people can do that you can't.
-Let me try to describe it, and they'll use it against me but notice they don't touch it because it's their whole religion and can't stand I'm talking about it. By the time I was like three years old I would have this dream that God has. Because God knows everything, is just super intelligent, omnipresent, unlimited dimensions, but God doesn't know where God came from. So just like we're trying to find out where we came from, God is like a virtual reality simulation as well. And God is constantly running every program, every operation, turning evil loose, good loose, everything. So I would have these dreams. My earliest memories, like two, three years old, where I would fly out the edge of infinity and it was a continual message (stares into the void): "Find out where we came from. Find out where it and then this big, giant, spinning, black vortex -like a black hole- and then I would have to figure out what was going on. Never it was the same thing, and so it is incredible frustrating. So then growing up and dealing with things, questioning politics and questioning all these other areas. Then having dreams that come true exactly and knowing what's going to happen before it happens, and then questioning it, and then never being wrong. I would be like weird. There's so much crazy stuff man, like just so much stuff where you can't even deal with. You dial it out and then you just reach that point where you don't even know what's real anymore because it's so crazy. But then you see the mathematics of the whole system and you know how it works. It's not like you're some schizophrenic. No. You talk about it. You deal with it. It actually works. So now when you fight the system you automatically know what to do. When you talk about something and the president word-for-word repeats me, Trump, that's what freaks them out. Word for word. A whole speech. I'm out on power trip. That's why they flipped out about it; the CIA and everyone else now think "Jones is connected to Trump, and Trump is like an idiot-savant"
-What does that have to do with the speech? Trump's speech? Explain that. I'm trying to follow you.
-I don't even know. I don't even know. It's a thing.
-It's hard to follow you sometimes. You where talking about God, then you were talking about Trump's speech abilities, then...
-Okay so God, God knows everything, except where God came from.
-That's good. Do you think that God is just like every other system that we see? Think of this: there's no one bird that's running all the birds. There's no one person that's running all the people. There's no one... it's all chaos. Even if we elect someone, half the people hate him. Everybody's in chaos. There's a contant power struggle. Do you think that God is decentralized? Do you think that the idea of God is decentralized? That maybe God is a real thing, but God's not one person. God is literally different organisms. God is not just free will, it's consciousness, it's all the organisms, it's every technological innovation known.
-God is epxeriencing consciousness through all of us
-I know this. I could say God might be decentralized. I could say God might just be like every other organism of the planet. It's just something that's moving in a certain direction, trying to procreate itself, trying to advance and trying to innovate, and trying to be better than it was yesterday. That's what everything is doing. Every fucking animal that started out as a single-celled organism is trying to survive because...
-But it's not like they created themselves
-Well, it's not necessarily that it didn't create itself but something created it, slowly but surely. Let's say that through the process of evolution and mutation
-This, we could keep going on for hours. We should have an epic podcast, but the point is we should not give up
-Let's not give up
-The point is: there is a pro-human future and a pro-free-will future, and the globalists are all anti-human, anti-freewill future. So all I know is to swim towards the light, for a pro-human future.
